# Analysis of gene expression profiles (tissuesGeneExpression)

## Gene expression profiles for 189 biological samples taken from seven different tissue types

This is a subset of the data provided by the `tissuesGeneExpression` package available from the `genomicsclass` GitHub repository. The predictors are gene expression measurements from 500 genes that are a random subset of the original 22,215.

## Heatmap & Dendrogram

Heatmap created using the 50 most variable genes and the function heatmap.2. The dendrograms that are added on top and on the side are created with hierarchical clustering.
